# Shop Finder App (In Development)

This app lists shops nearby the current location of the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The Java code is available in the backend sub-project. The frontend sub-project contains the javascript code.

### Application Data

First of all, you need to setup the MongoDB database.

A MongoDB dump with ~300 shops is provided. To import the data, you need to extract the zip file then execute the command below :

```
mongorestore --db shops shops/
```

→ → A shop database will be created with a shops collection.

→ → Dump File : https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/dump-shops.zip[here]


### Running the backend (recommended)

The recommended way to launch the server is to use your favorite java IDE.The main method of the application is in the `ShopFinderApplication` class.

### Running the frontend (recommended)

**You will need node 8.9.4+ and yarn to run the dev server and build the project**

I strongly recommend that you install yarn on your development machine.

After running the backend, in the project directory you can run:

```
./gradlew frontend:start
```

This command runs the frontend in development mode. +
Open http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser

### Alternatives for running the projects

There is also a gradle task to run the spring server. +
In the project directory you can run:

```
./gradlew frontend:bootRun
```

This command runs the backend in development mode.

### Hot reloading

With the dev server running, saving your javascript or css files will automatically trigger the hot reloading
(without browser refresh) of the application.

For the backend, recompiling the project in your IDE will trigger the reloading of the application's class loader.

## Deployment

This command will build the frontend and include it in the jar.

```
./gradlew clean build
```

The jar will be available in `./build/libs/shop-finder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

You can then launch it with:

```
java -jar build/libs/shop-finder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Then, you can open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080] to view the application in the browser.

NB: The frontend can be build alone with the `bundle` task so you can use `frontend:bundle`.
The backend `build` task depends on the frontend `bundle` task.
